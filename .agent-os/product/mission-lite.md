# Product Mission (Lite)

Quiz App is a lightweight, type-safe quiz app that prioritizes simplicity—no logins, no accounts—so one person can build a quiz and another can immediately try it with instant feedback.

It serves instructors and teams who need frictionless assessments without adopting a full LMS. The primary differentiators are end-to-end type safety (shared models across FE/BE), a lightweight self-hostable Node.js + SQLite stack, and a fast developer/user experience powered by Vite + React.
